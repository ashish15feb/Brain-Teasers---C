void circumAndAreaOfCircle(int r);

//The function takes radius 'r' as argument
//Calculate circumference = 2*PI*r
//Calculate Area =  PI*r*r
//Print the calculated values





int findNumberInArray(int num, int array[], int len);

//The function takes 3 parameters – num: number to search, array: list of numbers, len: length of array

//search for “num” in a loop till the end of array defined by "len"

//Initialize a variable called "index" with -1, if "num" is found in the "array" update "index" with the location index where "num" is found

//return "index"

void findMostFrequentCharacter(char array[], int len);


//It will take character “array” (string) and length “len” of this array

//Define a new int array – “count” with length of 128 elements to store the "COUNT OF OCCURRENCES” for each character by ASCII of that character as Index. Initialize by setting "0" for all elements.

//Traverse through "array", Increment the index element in "count" matching ASCII of the character  of "array" by "1"

//Find the index of element in "count" having maximum value, ignore white-spaces

//The index is ASCII of the character which is most frequent in the given string






void productOfMatrics(int matrics1[10][10],int matrics2[10][10],int rowMatrcics1,int colMatrcics1,int rowMatrcics2,int colMatrcics2);

//The function takes two 2-dimensional arrays, and number of Rows and columns of both matrices

//Declare a new matrics result[][] having rows  rowMatrcics1 and Columns colMatrcics2.

//Calculate elements of the result[][] by using matrix multiplication method.
